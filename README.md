**SickBeardTaskbar**
SickBeardTaskbar is a Cocoa-Applescript project, that is used to start and quit SickBeard, and leaving a StickBeard icon on the OS X's Statusbar, as a proof that you have started SickBeard.
It was made mainly because I did not want to have a terminal window running (it's a bit  distracting), and I didn't want a icon in the dock for a task I wouldn't interact with, and I didn't want to lose the ability to quit SickBeard if I wanted to.
